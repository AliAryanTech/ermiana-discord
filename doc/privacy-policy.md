## Data Collected
With the consent of you and your server administrator, Ermiana may read the content of messages sent by you in Discord servers for webpage preview parsing, but none of this message content will be stored. Ermiana will NEVER STORE any of your user data, including but not limited to your avatar, description, messages, and pictures sent. Rest assured that your personal data will always be kept safe and protected by Discord's high-quality service.

## Data Removal
This part comes upon request. However, Ermiana DOES NOT STORE any data, so nothing can be deleted. All the source code is public and can be reviewed by anyone. If you still have any questions, you can send a written description of your questions, including your name and your Discord account ID, to admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @).
