# Terms of Service
Effective: November 1, 2023  
Last Updated: April 14, 2024

## What You Can Expect from Us
Ermiana is a Discord bot that fixes sites with broken preview by providing more detailed images and webpage content. Supports multiple popular sites in Taiwan, including ptt.cc, gamer.com.tw, e-hentai, Plurk, Pixiv, and Twitter.  

## Using the Service
With the consent of you and your server administrator, Ermiana may read the content of messages sent by you in Discord servers for webpage preview parsing, but none of this message content will be stored. Ermiana will NEVER STORE any of your user data, which includes but is not limited to your avatar, description, messages, and pictures sent. When a server administrator adds Ermiana to a server, they should read and agree to the terms of service, and fulfill the obligation to notify server members. If a server administrator does not agree to the terms of service, they should immediately cease using Ermiana and remove it from the server. When server members use Ermiana, they should read and agree to the terms of service. If a server member does not agree to the terms of service, they should immediately cease using Ermiana and leave all servers containing Ermiana.

## Responsibility
All webpage previews and images transmitted by Ermiana are quoted from messages sent by users. When you use Ermiana, you understand and agree that all comments and images are made by the original authors of the webpages contained in the messages sent by users, and have nothing to do with Ermiana. Ermiana only provides automatic parsing of webpage previews and images, DOES NOT store any data, and DOES NOT eendorse or object to any comments. You understand and agree that the responsibility for all comments lies entirely with the users sending the messages and the original authors of the webpages.

## Settling Disputes
Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires sending @canaria3406 a written description of the dispute, including your name, the nature of your complaint, and how you'd like to resolve it, along with your Discord account ID, to admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @). If there are unresolved issues necessitating litigation, both parties agree that the governing law shall be the laws of Taiwan, and Taiwan Taipei District Court shall serve as the court of first instance.

## Software
Ermiana is an open-source project released on GitHub under the MIT license. You can view the source code at https://github.com/canaria3406/ermiana. You can reproduce this code in any form, but you need to include the GitHub URL of ermiana's source code in the bot's description when publishing the bot on Discord.
