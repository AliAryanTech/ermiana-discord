# Terms of Service

## What You Can Expect from Us
ermiana is a Discord bot that converts uninformative webpage previews into more detailed images and webpage previews. It supports multiple websites such as ptt.cc, 巴哈姆特電玩資訊站, e-hentai, Plurk, Pixiv, and Twitter. ermiana can read the content of messages sent in your Discord server; however, no messages are stored. ermiana will NEVER STORE any of your data, including but not limited to your photos, self-introduction, message, and pictures sent. Your personal data will always be safe.

## Software
ermiana is an open-source project released on GitHub under the MIT license. You can view the source code at https://github.com/canaria3406/ermiana. You can reproduce this code in any form, but you need to include the GitHub URL of the project in the bot's description when publishing the bot on Discord.

## Responsibility
All comments made by ermiana are quotes from messages sent by users. When you use this service, you understand that all comments are made by the original author and have nothing to do with this service. This service only parses the content of the website and does not endorse or object to any speech. The responsibility for all speech lies with the user and the original author.

## Settling Disputes
Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires sending @canaria3406 a written description of the dispute, including your name, the nature of your complaint, and how you'd like to resolve it, along with your Discord account ID, to admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @). If there are matters that cannot be negotiated and litigation is required, both parties agree that the laws of Taiwan(ROC) will be the governing law, and the Taipei District Court in Taiwan will be the court of first instance.

## Bug Reporting
We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please visit https://github.com/canaria3406/ermiana/discussions.

## Contact
If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us at admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @).
