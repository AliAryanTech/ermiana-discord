Last Updated: November 7, 2023

## What You Can Expect from Us
Ermiana is a Discord bot designed to enhance webpage previews by providing more detailed images and webpage content. It supports various websites, including ptt.cc, gamer.com.tw, e-hentai, Plurk, Pixiv, and Twitter.  
Ermiana will NEVER STORE any of your user data, which includes but is not limited to your avatar, description, messages, and pictures sent. Rest assured that your personal data will always be kept safe and protected by Discord's high-quality service.

## Software
Ermiana is an open-source project released on GitHub under the MIT license. You can view the source code at https://github.com/canaria3406/ermiana. You can reproduce this code in any form, but you need to include the GitHub URL of ermiana's source code in the bot's description when publishing the bot on Discord.

## Responsibility
All comments made by Ermiana are quotes from messages sent by users. When you use this service, you understand that all comments are made by the original author and have nothing to do with this service. This service only parses the content of the website and does not endorse or object to any comments. The responsibility for all comments lies with the user and the original author.

## Settling Disputes
Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires sending @canaria3406 a written description of the dispute, including your name, the nature of your complaint, and how you'd like to resolve it, along with your Discord account ID, to admin#canaria.cc (replace # with @).  
If there are unresolved issues necessitating litigation, both parties agree that the governing law shall be the laws of Taiwan (ROC), and Taiwan Taipei District Court shall serve as the court of first instance.

## Bug Reporting
We support the reporting of vulnerabilities. To report any issue, please visit https://github.com/canaria3406/ermiana/discussions.

## Contact
